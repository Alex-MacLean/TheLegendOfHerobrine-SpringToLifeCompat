# The Legend of Herobrine Spring to Life Compatibility
Adds Spring to Life Backport Compatibility to The Legend of Herobrine.

**Note about this branch**: For some reason there is a crash in the development environment only when leaf litter from STL Backport is present in the scene due to biome color cache being null. No idea why this happens, why only the development environment is affected and why the creator of STL Backport doesn't seem to have this issue. To be completely clear the actual production, typical user, environment does not have this crash, therefore STL Backport is considered fully functional for general use. This made testing a bit inconvenient, but being such a small mod and having a powerful computer everything went by quickly.

This repo can also serve as an example for developing addons for The Legend of Herobrine.
